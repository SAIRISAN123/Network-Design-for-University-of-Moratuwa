Design-of-Local-Area-Network---Group-Project
We have designed the backbone network for University of Moratuwa (UOM) and the internal network of one building (ENTC)

UOM has multiple buildings housing academic faculties/departments, administrative offices, library and data center building (Center for Information Technology Services - CITeS). All these building need to be connected.
Backbone network is designed for long term use (say 20-25 years). It is important to consider the total cost for cabling. Your design must contain both active and passive systems. Follow the best practices as given in the lecture notes.

Study the local area network of ENTC as a reference design for LAN. You should look the complete network and how the cabling network is laid, different elements of the cabling network such as network sockets, patch panels (copper as well as fibre), distribution racks, copper and fibre patch cords, network switches and routers etc.,

Use GNS3 Cisco Packet Tracer network emulator to simulate ENTC network first and then do the same for backbone network.

You are required to submit the following:

A concise report that includes the following:
a) the approach to your backbone design with proper justification. E.g. you need to explain why you have chosen a particular topology.

b) Network diagram clearly indicating all the building nodes and bandwidth in each link. Please note that you will be using the same network for routing simulation later.

c) IP addressing scheme for network (IPv4 and IPv6). Please note that for each node in the network to which a building network is connected is to be given a appropriately dimensioned IPv4/IPv6 network.

d) Justification for the selection of active (switches/routers) and passive components. E.g. single mode vs multimode. How many ports in each router etc.,

e) Features/specifications of the routers/switches in backbone network

f) Bill of Quantities separately for passive and active components for the backbone (you can take your observations of ENTC network as a reference for this - prepare the BOQ for ENTC network first as you can see that physically).

g). Simulation results
